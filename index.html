    <h1>JOHN 3:16</h1>
    <P>For God so loveth the world, that he hath given his only begotten Son, 
         that whosoever believethin him, should not perish, but have everlasting
          life.
    </P>
    <p>(Isiah. 40:31)
      “But they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength; 
      they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they 
      shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint” .
    </p>
    <p>
      For if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, 
      and shalt believe in thine heart, that God raised him up from the dead, 
      thou shalt be saved:

      <p>
        Salvation is in His blood, no one comes to the 
        Father God except through him
        
        For if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, 
        and shalt believe in thine heart, that God raised him up from the dead, 
        thou shalt be saved:The words that I speak unto you, 
        I speak not of myself: but the Father that dwelleth in me, 
        he doeth the works.

        11 Believe me, that I am in the Father, and the Father is in me: 
        at the least, believe me for the very works’ sake.
        
        12 [j]Verily, verily I say unto you, he that believeth in me, 
        the works that I do, he shall do also, and [k]greater than 
        these shall he do: for I go unto my Father.
